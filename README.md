This repository is destined to hold files in order to display some of the main Data Analytical skills developed by me, Gustavo Garofalo, in the past couple of years.

Most of the skills displayed here were learned either by self studying or formal education, one of which is the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, an intensive 24 week program offered by the University of Central Florida (Cerificate awarded in March 2020).

Data Analysis is important, but primarily important is to have a well organized database, that allows the users to add and retrieve data in a proper way. SQL is a tool specifically for that.

The skill displayed in this repository is SQL.
